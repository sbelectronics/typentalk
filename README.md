# Votrax Type N Talk Text To Speech, converted to C++

Scott Baker, http://www.smbaker.com/

This is a port of the Votrax Type N Talk from 6800 assembly
to C++. It's ugly and nasty and has undergone only minimal
work to make it appropriate for a high-level language.

The goal is to be able to reproduce the T n T text-to-phoneme
algorith,

The original assembly source came from a disassembly that
was done by Simon Rowe. Dr. Hugo Holden's article
"Type 'N Talk meets the HERO Jr. ROBOT" was quite useful in
understanding some of the idiosyncracies of the Type N
Talk device.

`make test` should run the code through a series of tests that
will verify it converts several known words correctly.

There is still much to do. A lot of this is autogenerated.
